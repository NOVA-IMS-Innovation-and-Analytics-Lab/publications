Abstract
========

In spite of its importance in sustainable resource management, the automatic
production of Land Use/Land Cover maps continues to be a challenging problem.
The ability to build robust automatic classifiers able to produce accurate maps
can have a significant impact in the way we manage and optimize natural
resources. The difficulty in achieving these results comes from many different
factors, such as data quality and uncertainty, among others. In this paper, we
address the imbalanced learning problem, a common and difficult problem in
remote sensing that affects the quality of classifiers. Having very asymmetric
distributions of the different classes constitutes a significant hurdle for any
classifier. In this work, we propose Geometric-SMOTE as a means of addressing
the imbalanced learning problem in remote sensing. Geometric-SMOTE is a
sophisticated oversampling algorithm which increases the quality of the
generated instances over previous methods, such as Synthetic Minority
Oversampling TEchnique. The performance of Geometric-SMOTE, in the the LUCAS
dataset, is compared to other oversamplers using a variety of classifiers. The
results show that Geometric-SMOTE significantly outperforms all the other
oversamplers and improves the robustness of the classifiers. These results
indicate that, when using imbalanced datasets, remote sensing researchers should
consider the use of these new generation oversamplers to increase the quality of
the classification results.
