## Projects

Each publication corresponds to a [Kedro](https://kedro.org/) project. Take a look at the [Kedro
documentation](https://docs.kedro.org) to get started.

### How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

### How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the files `src/tests/test_run.py` and `src/tests/pipelines/test_data_science.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. Run the tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

To configure the coverage threshold, look at the `.coveragerc` file.
