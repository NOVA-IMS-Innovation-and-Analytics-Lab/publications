Geometric SMOTE: Effective oversampling for
imbalanced learning through a geometric extension
of SMOTE

Abstract
########

Classification of imbalanced datasets is a challenging task for standard algorithms. Although
many methods exist to address this problem in different ways, generating artificial
data for the minority class is a more general approach compared to algorithmic modifications.
SMOTE algorithm and its variations generate synthetic samples along a line segment that
joins minority class instances. In this paper we propose Geometric SMOTE (G-SMOTE) as
a generalization of the SMOTE data generation mechanism. G-SMOTE generates synthetic
samples in a geometric region of the input space, around each selected minority instance.
While in the basic configuration this region is a hyper-sphere, G-SMOTE allows its deformation
to a hyper-spheroid and finally to a line segment, emulating, in the last case, the
SMOTE mechanism. The performance of G-SMOTE is compared against multiple standard
oversampling algorithms. We present empirical results that show a significant improvement
in the quality of the generated data when G-SMOTE is used as an oversampling algorithm.
