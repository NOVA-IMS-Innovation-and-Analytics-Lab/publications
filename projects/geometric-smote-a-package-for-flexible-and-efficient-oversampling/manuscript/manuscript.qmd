# geometric-smote: A package for flexible and efficient oversampling

## Abstract

Learning from class-imbalanced data continues to be a frequent and challenging problem in machine learning. Standard classification algorithms are designed under the assumption that the distribution of classes is balanced. To mitigate this problem several approaches have been proposed. The most general and popular approach is the generation of artificial data for the minority classes, known as oversampling. Geometric SMOTE is a state-of-the-art oversampling algorithm that has been shown to outperform other standard oversamplers in a large number of datasets. In order to make available Geometric SMOTE to the machine learning community, in this paper we provide a Python implementation. It is important to note that this implementation integrates seamlessly with the Scikit-Learn ecosystem. Therefore, machine learning researchers and practitioners can benefit from its use in a straightforward manner.

### Introduction

The imbalanced learning problem is defined as a machine learning classification task using datasets with binary or multi-class targets where one of the classes, called the majority class, outnumbers significantly the remaining classes, called the minority class(es) ([Chawla 2003](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)). Learning from imbalanced data is a frequent and non-trivial problem for academic researchers and industry practitioners alike. The imbalance learning problem can be found in multiple domains such as chemical and biochemical engineering, financial management, information technology, security, business, agriculture or emergency management ([Haixiang 2017](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)).

Standard machine learning classification algorithms induce a bias towards the majority class during training. This results in low performance when metrics suitable for imbalanced data are used for the classifier's evaluation. An important characteristic of imbalanced data is the Imbalance Ratio ($IR$) which is defined as the ratio between the number of samples of the majority class and each of the minority classes. For example, in a fraud detection task with 1% of fraudulent transactions, corresponding to an $IR=\frac{0.99}{0.01}=99$, a trivial classifier that always labels a transaction as legit will score a classification accuracy of $99%$. However in this case, all fraud cases remain undetected. $IR$ values between $100$ and $100.000$ have been observed ([Chawla2002](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e), [Barua2014](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)). Figure 1 shows an example of imbalanced data in two dimensions and the resulting decision boundary of a typical classifier when they are used as a training set.

### Oversampling algorithms

Various approaches have been proposed to deal with the imbalanced learning problem. The most general approach is the modification at the data level by oversampling the minority class(es) ([Fernandez 2013](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)). Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was the first informed oversampling algorithm proposed and continuous to be extensively used  ([Chawla 2002](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)). It generates synthetic instances along a line segment that joins minority class samples. Although SMOTE has been shown to be effective for generating artificial data, it also has some weaknesses ([He 2009](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)). In order to improve the quality of the generated data, many variants of SMOTE have been proposed. Nevertheless, all of these variations use the same data generation mechanism, i.e. linear interpolation between minority class samples as shown in figure 2.

A Python implementation of SMOTE and several of its variants is available in the [Imbalanced-Learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/) library ([Lemaitre 2016](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)), which is fully compatible with the popular machine learning toolbox [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  ([Pedregosa 2011](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)).

### Geometric SMOTE

The Geometric SMOTE (G-SMOTE) oversampling algorithm ([Douzas 2019](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)) uses a different approach compared to existing SMOTE's variations. More specifically, G-SMOTE oversampling algorithm substitutes the data generation mechanism of SMOTE by defining a flexible geometric region around each minority class instance and generating synthetic instances inside the boundaries of this region. The algorithm requires the selection of the hyperparameters `truncation_factor` , `deformation_factor`, `selection_strategy` and `k_neighbors`. The first three of them, called geometric hyperparameters, control the shape of the geometric region while the later adjusts its size. Figure 3 presents a visual comparison between the data generation mechanisms of SMOTE and G-SMOTE.

G-SMOTE algorithm has been shown to outperform SMOTE and its variants across $69$ imbalanced datasets for various classifiers and evaluation metrics ([Douzas 2019](:/0ad29a2551e6479cbb34feead5fb367e)). In this paper, we present a Python implementation of G-SMOTE. In section 2, the software description is given while section 3 provides a demonstrative example of its functionalities.

### Software description

The `geometric-smote` software project is written in Python 3.7. It contains an object-oriented implementation of the G-SMOTE algorithm as well as an extensive [online documentation](https://geometric-smote.readthedocs.io/). The implementation provides an API that is compatible with Imbalanced-Learn and Scikit-Learn libraries, therefore it makes full use of various features that support standard machine learning functionalities.

#### Software Architecture

The `geometric-smote` project contains the Python package `gsmote`. The main module of `gsmote` is called `geometric-smote.py`. It contains the class `GeometricSMOTE` that implements the G-SMOTE algorithm. The initialization of a `GeometricSMOTE` instance includes G-SMOTE's hyperparameters that control the generation of synthetic data. Additionally, `GeometricSMOTE` inherits from the `BaseOverSampler` class of Imbalanced-Learn library. Therefore, an instance of `GeometricSMOTE` class provides the `fit` and `fit_resample` methods, the two main methods for resampling as explained in subsection. This is achieved by implementing the `fit_resample` abstract method of the parent class `BaseOverSampler`. More specifically, the function `_make_geometric_sample` implements the data generation mechanism of G-SMOTE as shortly described in subsection. This function is called in the `_make_geometric_samples` method of the `GeometricSMOTE` class in order to generate the appropriate number of synthetic data for a particular minority class. Finally, the method `_make_geometric_samples` is called in `_fit_resample` method to generate synthetic data for all minority classes. Figure 3 provides a visual representation of the above classes and functions hierarchy.

#### Software Functionalities

As it was mentioned in subsection, the class `GeometricSMOTE` represents the G-SMOTE oversampler. The intializer of `GeometricSMOTE` includes the following G-SMOTE's hyperparameters: `truncation_factor`, `deformation_factor`, `selection_strategy` and `k_neighbors` as explained in subsection. Once the `GeometricSMOTE` object is initialized with a specific parametrization, it can be used to resample the imbalanced data represented by the input matrix `X` and the target labels `y`. Following the Scikit-Learn API, both `X`, `y` are array-like objects of appropriate shape.

Resampling is achieved by using the two main methods of `fit` and `fit_resample` of the `GeometricSMOTE` object. More specifically, both of them take as input parameters the `X` and `y`. The first method computes various statistics which are used to resample `X` while the second method does the same but additionally returns a resampled version of `X` and `y`.

The `geometric-smote` project has been designed to integrate with the Imbalanced-Learn toolbox and Scikit-Learn ecosystem. Therefore the `GeometricSMOTE` object can be used in a machine learning pipeline, through Imbalanced-Learn's class `Pipeline`, that automatically combines `samplers`, `transformers` and `estimators`. The next section provides examples of the above functionalities.

### Illustrative Examples

#### Basic example

An example of resampling multi-class imbalanced data using the `fit_resample` method is presented in Listing 1. Initially, a 3-class imbalanced dataset is generated. Next, `GeometricSMOTE` object is initialized with default values for the hyperparameters, i.e. `truncation_factor=1.0`, `deformation_factor=0.0`, `selection_strategy='combined'`. Finally, the object's `fit_resample` method is used to resample the data. Printing the class distribution before and after resampling confirms that the resampled data `X_res`, `y_res` are perfectly balanced. `X_res`, `y_res` can be used as training data for any classifier in the place of `X`, `y`.

```python
# Import classes and functions.

from collections import Counter
from gsmote import GeometricSMOTE
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate an imbalanced 3-class dataset.

X, y = make_classification(
random_state=23,
n_classes=3,
n_informative=5,
n_samples=500,
weights=\[0.8, 0.15, 0.05\]
)

# Create a GeometricSMOTE object with default hyperparameters.

gsmote = GeometricSMOTE(random_state=10)

# Resample the imbalanced dataset.

X\_res, y\_res = gsmote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Print number of samples per class for initial and resampled data.

init_count = list(Counter(y).values())
resampled\_count = list(Counter(y\_res).values())

print(f'Initial class distribution: {init_count}.')

# Initial class distribution: \[400, 75, 25\].

print(f'Resampled class distribution: {resampled_count}.')

# Resampled class distribution: \[400, 400, 400\].
```

#### Machine learning pipeline

As mentioned before, the `GeometricSMOTE` object can be used as a part of a machine learning pipeline. Listing \\ref{lst:pipeline} presents a pipeline composed by a G-SMOTE oversampler, a PCA tranformation and a decision tree classifier. The pipeline is trained on imbalanced binary-class data and evaluated on a hold-out set. The user applies the process in a simple way while the internal details of the calculations are hidden.

```python
# Import classes and functions.

from gsmote import GeometricSMOTE
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model\_selection import train\_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from imblearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Generate an imbalanced binary-class dataset.

X, y = make_classification(
random_state=23,
n_classes=2,
n_samples=500,
weights=\[0.8, 0.2\]
)

# Split the data to training and hold-out sets.

X\_train, X\_test, y\_train, y\_test = train\_test\_split(X, y, random_state=0)

# Create the pipeline's objects with default hyperparameters.

gsmote = GeometricSMOTE(random_state=11)
pca = PCA()
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=3)

# Create the pipeline.

pip = make_pipeline(gsmote, pca, clf)

# Fit the pipeline to the training set.

pip.fit(X\_train, y\_train)

# Evaluate the pipeline on the hold-out set using the F-score.

test\_score = f1\_score(y\_test, pip.predict(X\_test))

print(f'F-score on hold-out set: {test_score}.')

# F-score on hold-out set: 0.7.
```

### Impact and conclusions

Classification of imbalanced datasets is a challenging task for standard machine learning algorithms. G-SMOTE, as a enhancement of the SMOTE data generation mechanism, provides a flexible and effective way for resampling the imbalanced data. G-SMOTE's emprical results prove that it outperforms SMOTE and its variants. Machine learning researchers and industry practitioners can benefit from using G-SMOTE in their work since the imbalanced learning problem is a common characteristic of many real-world applications.

The `geometric-smote` project provides the only Python implementation, to the best of our knowledge, of the state-of-the-art oversampling algorithm G-SMOTE. A significant advantage of this implementation is that it is built on top of the Scikit-Learn's ecosystem. Therefore, using the G-SMOTE oversampler in typical machine learning workflows is an effortless task for the user. Also, the public API of the main class `GeometricSMOTE` is identical to the one implemented in Imbalanced-Learn for all oversamplers. This means that users of Imbalanced-Learn and Scikit-Learn, that apply oversampling on imbalanced data, can integrate the `gsmote` package in their existing work in a straightforward manner or even replace directly any Imbalanced-Learn's oversampler with `GeometricSMOTE`.
