	abstract = {Designing profitable and reliable trading strategies is challenging in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Existing works applied deep reinforcement learning methods and optimistically reported increased profits in backtesting, which may suffer from the false positive issue due to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a practical approach to address backtest overfitting for cryptocurrency trading using deep reinforcement learning. First, we formulate the detection of backtest overfitting as a hypothesis test. Then, we train the DRL agents, estimate the probability of overfitting, and reject the overfitted agents, increasing the chance of good trading performance. Finally, on 10 cryptocurrencies over a testing period from 05/01/2022 to 06/27/2022 (during which the crypto market crashed two times), we show that the less overfitted deep reinforcement learning agents have a higher return than that of more overfitted agents, an equal weight strategy, and the S\&amp;P DBM Index (market benchmark), offering confidence in possible deployment to a real market.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) based machine trading attracts a rich profusion of interest. However, in the existing research, RL in the day-trade task suffers from the noisy financial movement in the short time scale, difficulty in order settlement, and expensive action search in a continuous-value space. This paper introduced an end-to-end RL intraday trading agent, namely QF-TraderNet, based on the quantum finance theory (QFT) and deep reinforcement learning. We proposed a novel design for the intraday RL trader’s action space, inspired by the Quantum Price Levels (QPLs). Our action space design also brings the model a learnable profit-and-loss control strategy. QF-TraderNet composes two neural networks: 1) A long short term memory networks for the feature learning of financial time series; 2) a policy generator network (PGN) for generating the distribution of actions. The profitability and robustness of QF-TraderNet have been verified in multi-type financial datasets, including FOREX, metals, crude oil, and financial indices. The experimental results demonstrate that QF-TraderNet outperforms other baselines in terms of cumulative price returns and Sharpe Ratio, and the robustness in the acceidential market shift.},

Effective offline reinforcement learning methods would be able to extract policies with the maximum possible utility out of the available data, thereby allowing automation of a wide range of decision-making domains, from healthcare and education to robotics. However, the limitations of current algorithms make this difficult.

There are multiple time scale features in financial time series due to different durations of impact factors and traders’ trading behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hybrid neural network, a model based on multiple time scale feature learning to predict the price trend of the stock market index. Firstly, the hybrid neural network extracts two types of features on different time scales through the first and second layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN), together with the raw daily price series, reflect relatively short-, medium- and long-term features in the price sequence. Secondly, considering time dependencies existing in the three kinds of features, the proposed hybrid neural network leverages three long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to capture such dependencies, respectively. Finally, fully connected layers are used to learn joint representations for predicting the price trend. The proposed hybrid neural network demonstrates its effectiveness by outperforming benchmark models on the real dataset.},

Reinforcement learning has become of particular interest to financial traders ever since the program AlphaGo defeated the strongest human contemporary Go board game player Lee Sedol in 2016. We systematically reviewed all recent stock/forex prediction or trading articles that used reinforcement learning as their primary machine learning method. All reviewed articles had some unrealistic assumptions such as no transaction costs, no liquidity issues and no bid or ask spread issues. Transaction costs had significant impacts on the profitability of the reinforcement learning algorithms compared with the baseline algorithms tested. Despite showing statistically significant profitability when reinforcement learning was used in comparison with baseline models in many studies, some showed no meaningful level of profitability, in particular with large changes in the price pattern between the system training and testing data. Furthermore, few performance comparisons between reinforcement learning and other sophisticated machine/deep learning models were provided. The impact of transaction costs, including the bid/ask spread on profitability has also been assessed. In conclusion, reinforcement learning in stock/forex trading is still in its early development and further research is needed to make it a reliable method in this domain.},

We review and propose various modifications to existing approaches and explore different techniques like the usage of technical indicators, to succinctly capture the market dynamics to model the markets. We then go on to use deep reinforcement learning to enable the agent (the algorithm) to learn how to take profitable trades in any market on its own, while suggesting various methodology changes and leveraging the unique representation of the FMDP (financial MDP) to tackle the primary challenges faced in similar works. Through our experimentation results, we go on to show that our model could be easily extended to two very different financial markets and generates a positively robust performance in all conducted experiments.},

We demonstrate the use of an MDP to solve a sequential clinical treatment problem under uncertainty. Markov decision processes generalize standard Markov models in that a decision process is embedded in the model and multiple decisions are made over time. Furthermore, they have significant advantages over standard decision analysis. We compare MDPs to standard Markov-based simulation models by solving the problem of the optimal timing of living-donor liver transplantation using both methods. Both models result in the same optimal transplantation policy and the same total life expectancies for the same patient and living donor. The computation time for solving the MDP model is significantly smaller than that for solving the Markov model. We briefly describe the growing literature of MDPs applied to medical decisions.},

	abstract = {The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

We present an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces. Using the same learning algorithm, network architecture and hyper-parameters, our algorithm robustly solves more than 20 simulated physics tasks, including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving. Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives. We further demonstrate that for many of the tasks the algorithm can learn policies end-to-end: directly from raw pixel inputs.},

	abstract = {In value-based reinforcement learning methods such as deep Q-learning, function approximation errors are known to lead to overestimated value estimates and suboptimal policies. We show that this problem persists in an actor-critic setting and propose novel mechanisms to minimize its effects on both the actor and the critic. Our algorithm builds on Double Q-learning, by taking the minimum value between a pair of critics to limit overestimation. We draw the connection between target networks and overestimation bias, and suggest delaying policy updates to reduce per-update error and further improve performance. We evaluate our method on the suite of OpenAI gym tasks, outperforming the state of the art in every environment tested.},

We explore the potential of deep reinforcement learning to optimize stock trading strategy and thus maximize investment return. 30 stocks are selected as our trading stocks and their daily prices are used as the training and trading market environment. We train a deep reinforcement learning agent and obtain an adaptive trading strategy. The agent's performance is evaluated and compared with Dow Jones Industrial Average and the traditional min-variance portfolio allocation strategy. The proposed deep reinforcement learning approach is shown to outperform the two baselines in terms of both the Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.},

	abstract = {Financial portfolio management is the process of constant redistribution of a fund into different financial products. This paper presents a financial-model-free Reinforcement Learning framework to provide a deep machine learning solution to the portfolio management problem. The framework consists of the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, a Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), an Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme, and a fully exploiting and explicit reward function. This framework is realized in three instants in this work with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). They are, along with a number of recently reviewed or published portfolio-selection strategies, examined in three back-test experiments with a trading period of 30 minutes in a cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of the framework monopolize the top three positions in all experiments, outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although with a high commission rate of 0.25\% in the backtests, the framework is able to achieve at least 4-fold returns in 50 days.},

	abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},
