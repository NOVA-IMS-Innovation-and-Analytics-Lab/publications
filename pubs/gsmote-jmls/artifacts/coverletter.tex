Dear Editors:

We are writing to submit our manuscript ``\red{geometric-smote - A Package for Flexible and Efficient
Over-Sampling}'' to the \emph{Journal of Machine Learning Research}.

Our manuscript describes the implementation of the \red{Geometric SMOTE
algorithm, a state-of-the-art over-sampling algorithm that has been shown to
outperform other standard over-samplers in a large number of data sets}. Our
contribution is important because the \texttt{geoemtric-smote} software project
\red{provides the only Python implementation of Geometric SMOTE and integrates
seamlessly with the \texttt{scikit-learn} ecosystem}.

We suggest the following action editors and referees for our submission.

Action Editors
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{Guillaume Lemaitre , Parietal team, Inria, CEA, Universite Paris-Saclay (guillaume.lemaitre@inria.fr)}
    
\end{itemize}

Reviewers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{Fernando Nogueira, ResQ (fmfnogueira@gmail.com)}
    \item \red{Christos K. Aridas , Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Mathematics, University of Patras (char@upatras.gr)}
\end{itemize}

Our submission has the following keywords: \red{machine learning}, \red{classification}, \red{imbalanced learning}, \red{over-sampling}, \red{Python}.

As the corresponding author, I confirm that none of the co-authors listed below have a conflict of interest with the action editors and referees I suggest above. Further, I confirm that all co-authors below consent to my submission of this manuscript to the \emph{Journal of Machine Learning Research}.

Sincerely,
