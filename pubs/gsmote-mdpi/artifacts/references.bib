abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Classification of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) data is a typical task in remote-sensing domain. However, because the classes distribution in LULC data is naturally imbalance, it is difficult to do the classification. In this paper, we employ Variational Semi-Supervised Learning (VSSL) to solve imbalance problem in LULC of Jakarta City. This VSSL exploits the use of semi-supervised learning on deep learning model. Therefore, it is suitable for classifying data with abundant unlabeled like LULC. The result shows that VSSL achieves 80.17{\%} of overall accuracy, outperforming other algorithms in comparison.},

@article{Khatami2016,
abstract = {Classification of remotely sensed imagery for land-cover mapping purposes has attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners. Numerous studies conducted over several decades have investigated a broad array of input data and classification methods. However, this vast assemblage of research results has not been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the relative performance of different classification processes for generating land cover products. To address this problem, we completed a statistical meta-analysis of the past 15years of research on supervised per-pixel image classification published in five high-impact remote sensing journals. The two general factors evaluated were classification algorithms and input data manipulation as these are factors that can be controlled by analysts to improve classification accuracy. The meta-analysis revealed that inclusion of texture information yielded the greatest improvement in overall accuracy of land-cover classification with an average increase of 12.1{\%}. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the additional spatial context information provided by including texture. Inclusion of ancillary data, multi-angle and time images also provided significant improvement in classification overall accuracy, with 8.5{\%}, 8.0{\%}, and 6.9{\%} of average improvements, respectively. In contrast, other manipulation of spectral information such as index creation (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and feature extraction (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) offered much smaller improvements in accuracy. In terms of classification algorithms, support vector machines achieved the greatest accuracy, followed by neural network methods. The random forest classifier performed considerably better than the traditional decision tree classifier. Maximum likelihood classifiers, often used as benchmarking algorithms, offered low accuracy. Our findings will help guide practitioners to decide which classification to implement and also provide direction to researchers regarding comparative studies that will further solidify our understanding of different classification processes. However, these general guidelines do not preclude an analyst from incorporating personal preferences or considering specific algorithmic benefits that may be pertinent to a particular application.},

abstract = {Studies have demonstrated the robust performance of the ensemble machine learning classifier, random forests, for remote sensing land cover classification, particularly across complex landscapes. This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) in the context of large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest canopy cover classes) classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78.3{\%} Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70.1{\%} with 25{\%} mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82.3{\%} and 78.3{\%} for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy.},

abstract = {Many real-world classification tasks suffer from the class imbalanced problem, in which some classes are highly underrepresented as compared to other classes. In this paper, we focus on multi-class imbalance problems which are considerably more difficult to address than two-class imbalanced problems. On this account, we develop a novel and effective procedure, called dynamic ensemble selection for multi-class imbalanced datasets (DES-MI), in which the competence of the candidate classifiers are assessed with weighted instances in the neighborhood. The proposed DES-MI consists of two key components: the generation of balanced training datasets and the selection of appropriate classifiers. To do so, we develop a preprocessing procedure to balance the training dataset which relies on random balance. To select the most appropriate classifiers in the scenario of multi-class imbalance problems, we propose a weighting mechanism to highlight the competence of classifiers that are more powerful in classifying examples in the region of underrepresented competence. We develop a thorough experimental study in order to verify the benefits of DES-MI in handling multi-class imbalanced datasets. The obtained results, supported by the proper statistical analysis, indicate that DES-MI is able to improve the classification performance for multi-class imbalanced datasets.},

abstract = {Classification of imbalanced datasets is a challenging task for standard algorithms. Although many methods exist to address this problem in different ways, generating artificial data for the minority class is a more general approach compared to algorithmic modifications. SMOTE algorithm, as well as any other oversampling method based on the SMOTE mechanism, generates synthetic samples along line segments that join minority class instances. In this paper we propose Geometric SMOTE (G-SMOTE) as a enhancement of the SMOTE data generation mechanism. G-SMOTE generates synthetic samples in a geometric region of the input space, around each selected minority instance. While in the basic configuration this region is a hyper-sphere, G-SMOTE allows its deformation to a hyper-spheroid. The performance of G-SMOTE is compared against SMOTE as well as baseline methods. We present empirical results that show a significant improvement in the quality of the generated data when G-SMOTE is used as an oversampling algorithm. An implementation of G-SMOTE is made available in the Python programming language.},

@article{Saez2016,
abstract = {Canonical machine learning algorithms assume that the number of objects in the considered classes are roughly similar. However, in many real-life situations the distribution of examples is skewed since the examples of some of the classes appear much more frequently. This poses a difficulty to learning algorithms, as they will be biased towards the majority classes. In recent years many solutions have been proposed to tackle imbalanced classification, yet they mainly concentrate on binary scenarios. Multi-class imbalanced problems are far more difficult as the relationships between the classes are no longer straightforward. Additionally, one should analyze not only the imbalance ratio but also the characteristics of the objects within each class. In this paper we present a study on oversampling for multi-class imbalanced datasets that focuses on the analysis of the class characteristics. We detect subsets of specific examples in each class and fix the oversampling for each of them independently. Thus, we are able to use information about the class structure and boost the more difficult and important objects. We carry an extensive experimental analysis, which is backed-up with statistical analysis, in order to check when the preprocessing of some types of examples within a class may improve the indiscriminate preprocessing of all the examples in all the classes. The results obtained show that oversampling concrete types of examples may lead to a significant improvement over standard multi-class preprocessing that do not consider the importance of example types.},

The condition of multiple imbalanced classes is more restrictive when the aim of the final system is to obtain the most accurate precision for each of the concepts of the problem. The goal of this work is to provide a thorough experimental analysis that will allow us to determine the behaviour of the different approaches proposed in the specialised literature. First, we will make use of binarization schemes, i.e., one versus one and one versus all, in order to apply the standard approaches to solving binary class imbalanced problems. Second, we will apply several ad hoc procedures which have been designed for the scenario of imbalanced data-sets with multiple classes. This experimental study will include several well-known algorithms from the literature such as decision trees, support vector machines and instance-based learning, with the intention of obtaining global conclusions from different classification paradigms. The extracted findings will be supported by a statistical comparative analysis using more than 20 data-sets from the KEEL repository.},

In addition, the traditional difference map generated by log-ratio is subject to the speckle, which will reduce the accuracy. In this letter, an imbalanced learning-based change detection is proposed based on PCA network (PCA-Net), where a supervised PCA-Net is designed to obtain the robust features directly from given multitemporal SAR images instead of a difference map. Furthermore, to tackle with the imbalance between changed and unchanged classes, we propose a morphologically supervised learning method, where the knowledge in the pixels near the boundary between two classes are exploited to guide network training. Finally, our proposed PCA-Net can be trained by the datasets with available reference maps and applied to a new dataset, which is quite practical in change detection projects. Our proposed method is verified on five sets of multiple temporal SAR images. It is demonstrated from the experiment results that with the knowledge in training samples from the boundary, the learned features benefit for change detection and make the proposed method outperforms than supervised methods trained by randomly drawing samples.},

@article{Chawla2002,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Detailed information about seismic building structural types (SBSTs) is crucial for accurate earthquake vulnerability and risk modeling as it reflects the main load-bearing structures of buildings and, thus, the behavior under seismic load. However, for numerous urban areas in earthquake prone regions this information is mostly outdated, unavailable, or simply not existent. To this purpose, we present an effective approach to estimate SBSTs by combining scarce in situ observations, multi-sensor remote sensing data and machine learning techniques. In particular, an approach is introduced, which deploys a sequential procedure comprising five main steps, namely calculation of features from remote sensing data, feature selection, outlier detection, generation of synthetic samples, and supervised classification under consideration of both Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. Experimental results obtained for a representative study area, including large parts of the city of Padang (Indonesia), assess the capabilities of the presented approach and confirm its great potential for a reliable area-wide estimation of SBSTs and an effective earthquake loss modeling based on remote sensing, which should be further explored in future research activities.},

@article{Toth2013,
abstract = {Scientific. Free. In 2009, the European Commission extended the periodic Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) to sample and analyse the main properties of topsoil in 23 Member States of the European Union (EU). This topsoil survey represents the first attempt to build a consistent spatial database of the soil cover across The EU based on standard sampling and analytical procedures, with the analysis of all soil samples being carried out in a single laboratory. Approximately 20,000 points were selected out of the main LUCAS grid for the collection of soil samples. A standardised sampling procedure was used to collect around 0.5 kg of topsoil (0-20 cm). The samples were dispatched to a central laboratory for physical and chemical analyses. Subsequently, Malta and Cyprus provided soil samples even though the main LUCAS survey was not carried on their territories.{\^{}}Cyprus has adapted the sampling methodology of LUCAS-Topsoil for (the southern part of the island) while Malta adjusted its national sampling grid to correspond to the LUCAS standards. Bulgaria and Romania have been sampled in 2012. However, the analysis is ongoing and the results are not included in this report. The final database contains 19,967 geo-referenced samples. This report provides a detailed insight to the design and methodology of the data collection and laboratory analysis. All samples have been analysed for the percentage of coarse fragments, particle size distribution ({\%} clay, silt and sand content), pH (in CaCl2 and H2O), organic carbon (g/kg), carbonate content (g/kg), phosphorous content (mg/kg), total nitrogen content (g/kg), extractable potassium content (mg/kg), cation exchange capacity (cmol(+)/kg) and multispectral properties. Subsequently, heavy metal content is being analysed but the result are not yet available and thus not included in this report.{\^{}}Based on the results of the survey, the regional variability of topsoil properties within the EU has been assessed and a comparative soil assessment of European regions and countries is presented. A series of predictive maps have been prepared using digital soil mapping methodologies that show the variation of individual parameters across the EU. In addition, the data have been used in studies to determine the SOC stock of the uppermost 20 cm of soil in the EU. While the LUCAS approach is designed for monitoring land use/land cover change, potential bias in the sampling design may not necessarily capture all soil characteristics in a country. Finally, a customised application has been developed for web browsers that allow users to view and query the LUCAS dataset in a variety of ways.},

	abstract = {State of the art reviews of remote sensing change detection are becoming increasingly complicated and disparate due to an ever growing list of techniques, algorithms and methods. To provide a clearer, synoptic view of the field this review has organised the literature by the unit of analysis and the comparison method used to identify change. This significantly reduces the conceptual overlap present in previous reviews giving a succinct nomenclature with which to understand and apply change detection workflows. Under this framework, several decades of research have been summarised to provide an overview of current change detection approaches. Seven units of analysis and six comparison methods were identified and described highlighting the advantages and limitations of each within a change detection workflow. Of these, the pixel and post-classification change methods remain the most popular choices. In this review we extend previous summaries and provide an accessible description of the field. This supports future research by placing a clear separation between the analysis unit and the change classification method. This separation is then discussed, providing guidance for applied change detection research and future benchmarking experiments.},

@article{Pflugmacher2019,
	abstract = {This study analyzed, for the first time, the potential of combining the large European-wide land survey LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey) and Landsat-8 data for mapping pan-European land cover and land use. We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014–2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1{\%}, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9{\%} higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7{\%} higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country. CORINE substantially overestimated seasonal croplands by 63{\%} and underestimated grassland proportions by 37{\%}. Our study shows that combining current state-of-the-art remote sensing methods with the large LUCAS database improves pan-European land cover mapping. Although this study focuses on European land cover, the unique combination of large survey data and machine learning of spectral-temporal metrics, may also serve as a reference case for other regions. The pan-European land cover map for 2015 developed in this study is available under https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.896282.},

@article{Olofsson2013,
	abstract = {The area of land use or land cover change obtained directly from a map may differ greatly from the true area of change because of map classification error. An error-adjusted estimator of area can be easily produced once an accuracy assessment has been performed and an error matrix constructed. The estimator presented is a stratified estimator which is applicable to data acquired using popular sampling designs such as stratified random, simple random and systematic (the stratified estimator is often labeled a poststratified estimator for the latter two designs). A confidence interval for the area of land change should also be provided to quantify the uncertainty of the change area estimate. The uncertainty of the change area estimate, as expressed via the confidence interval, can then subsequently be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis for applications using land change area as an input (e.g., a carbon flux model). Accuracy assessments published for land change studies should report the information required to produce the stratified estimator of change area and to construct confidence intervals. However, an evaluation of land change articles published between 2005 and 2010 in two remote sensing journals revealed that accuracy assessments often fail to include this key information. We recommend that land change maps should be accompanied by an accuracy assessment that includes a clear description of the sampling design (including sample size and, if relevant, details of stratification), an error matrix, the area or proportion of area of each category according to the map, and descriptive accuracy measures such as user's, producer's and overall accuracy. Furthermore, mapped areas should be adjusted to eliminate bias attributable to map classification error and these error-adjusted area estimates should be accompanied by confidence intervals to quantify the sampling variability of the estimated area. Using data from the published literature, we illustrate how to produce error-adjusted point estimates and confidence intervals of land change areas. A simple analysis of uncertainty based on the confidence bounds for land change area is applied to a carbon flux model to illustrate numerically that variability in the land change area estimate can have a dramatic effect on model outputs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Accuracy assessment of classified imagery is an important task in remote sensing. Various measures have been developed to describe and compare the accuracy of maps and the performance of different classifiers, but the extent to which these measures are consistent with each other is largely unknown. In this paper the consistency of fourteen category-level and twenty map-level accuracy measures was tested on 595 published error matrices using nonparametric correlation coefficients (Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau-b) as well as the probability of concordance. The results show that four groups can be identified for the category-level measures and three groups for map-level measures. The consistency among the measures within a group is generally higher than that among the measures from different groups though all the measures at the same level are highly consistent with each other. We recommend that user's accuracy and producer's accuracy and the overall accuracy should be provided as primary accuracy measures and the two relative entropy change measures and the mutual information normalized by the arithmetic mean of the entropies on map and ground truthing be provided as supplementary measures. The chance-corrected, error matrix-normalized and user's and producer's accuracy-combined measures were found to contain estimation and interpretation problems at both category- and map-levels and are therefore not recommended for general use. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In view of this, we present the first version of the DFD Land Use and Land Cover Product for Germany, DFD-LULC{\_}DE, for the year 2014, generated from 702 Landsat-7 and Landat-8 scenes at 30 m resolution. The results were derived based on a fully automated preprocessing chain that integrates data acquisition, radiometric, atmospheric and topographic correction, as well as spectral–temporal feature extraction for all Landsat surface reflectance bands, brightness temperature and various spectral indices. The classification followed a two-step approach: first, an initial classification is performed using a Random Forest classifier trained on ground truth data obtained from the LUCAS survey of EUROSTAT, followed by a semi-automated sampling of additional training data to further improve the initial classification results. Automatic selection of appropriate training samples is based on the vote entropy derived from the initial classification, thereby keeping manual user interaction low. The approach demonstrated is promising, also with respect to a European wide application, and contributes towards the advancement and enhancement of the DLR-DFD's processing chains, which are directed towards the generation of land cover products at regular intervals being of central importance to related land monitoring and reporting services.},
